# rstan-nyc-taxi-fares
Final project for Bayesian modeling and computation class exploring NYC taxi fares and tips.

Hierarchical and non-hierarchical multiparameter models for mean taxi fare (normal model with unknown mean and unknown variance) and proportion of "big tippers" (beta/binomial model) in clusters within New York City (k-means clustered with k=250).
